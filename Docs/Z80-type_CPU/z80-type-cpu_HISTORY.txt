ntroduced by ZiLOG in the early '70s, the Z80 was an impressive processor for its time. 
The original Z80 (a 2MHz part) was a souped-up version of the then-popular Intel 8080 processor. 
While compatible with the 8080, the Z80 offered many new features: new instructions, new addressing modes, 
two index registers, faster execution, high performance peripheral chips, and a clever interrupt scheme. 
Soon, Z80s were available in higher speed grades (4MHz and 6MHz). 
For many years, the Z80 was the king of 8-bit processors.

In 1976, ZiLOG introduced the Z280, which was an enhanced Z80, but it turned out to be a big failure.
Around 1985, Hitachi introduced the 64180 microprocessor, which was an improved Z80. 
ZiLOG second-sourced the processor under the Z180 name. This 64-pin DIP processor executed most instructions 
with fewer clock cycles than the Z80 and contained a number of on-chip peripherals such as a pair of UARTS, 
a clocked serial I/O port, an on-chip interrupt controller, two DMA channels, two 16-bit timers, 
and an on-chip memory management unit allowing the '180 class processor to extend the address space from 64K 
to 1,024K. Although called an MMU, this device only implemented memory banking (described later).

In the mid '90s, ZiLOG announced the Z380 but, like the Z280, it never really went anywhere. 
Today, a number of companies are selling Z80-derived processors, including AB-Semicon, Kawasaki, LSI, NEC, 
Toshiba, and VAutomation.

Towards the end of last year, ZiLOG announced a new generation of Z80 derivatives. Around that same time, 
a new company called Rabbit Semiconductor introduced its own new generation of Z80 derivatives. 
ZiLOG's offering is called the eZ80 and is expected to hit the street in the second half of 2000. 
Rabbit Semiconductor's new processor is called the Rabbit 2000; it started shipping in November 1999. 
Rabbit Semiconductor was founded by its parent company Z World Inc. Z World has been around since 1981 
and has been using the Z80 and Z180/64180 extensively in its board-level controllers.

Annual volumes of Z80 flavors are reported to be at around 200 million units. I asked both ZiLOG and Rabbit 
why they would introduce new products based on a 25-year-old architecture. I got the same response from both: 
a lot of engineers (about 100,000), have used these chips at some point in their career, and are already 
familiar with the architecture. The Z80 architecture is simple to learn and still quite powerful. 
And, like any popular platform, there is a lot of valuable legacy software floating around for it. 
Finally, it's quite difficult and expensive to introduce completely new architectures. 
Both ZiLOG and Rabbit claim that their new processors rival 16-bit processors in performance.
