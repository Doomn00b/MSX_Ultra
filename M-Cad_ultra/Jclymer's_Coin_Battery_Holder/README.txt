# Summary

This is a holder for a coin cell battery.  There is one for a single battery and one for a double battery.

A stripped, 20 Gauge wire can be used to provide the electrical contact.  One wire is weaved through the holes on the bottom (-) and another wire is weaved through the holes on the side (+).  No soldering is necessary for stable electrical contact.  No soldering was done in the example photos.  A little soldering may clean up the aesthetics of the outside a little, but it is not not necessary.

The coin battery fits snug inside the case once the wires are put into place.  It is easy to put in by hand, but it may take a needle nose pliers to remove.
