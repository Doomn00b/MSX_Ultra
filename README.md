# MSX_Ultra
 MSX2+ compatible Mini-ITX computer system, inspired by Sergey Kiselev's Omega Home Computer.

 This project is an open source implementation, and extension, of an MSX2+ compatible computer. The project is modular, and is built using a combination of 1980's-1990's era components - Z380 CPU, V9958 VDP, YM2610 PSG/FM-generator, and some newer components, such as 512 KiB SRAM and 512 KiB Flash ROM and dual FPGA's for the MSX-engine/Chipset (AT40K FPGAs).
