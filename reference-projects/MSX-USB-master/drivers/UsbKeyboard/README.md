# Usb Keyboard
The USB Keyboard driver will automatically find the Unapi Usb driver and connect with it. It then checks if a HID compliant keyboard is connected. After that it will start it's resident portion that hooks itself to H.CHGE.

After this the keyboard will work within Basic and DOS and will replace the built-in keyboard. 
Software (games) that don't use BIOS for keyboard will continue to work on the built-in keyboard of the MSX.
