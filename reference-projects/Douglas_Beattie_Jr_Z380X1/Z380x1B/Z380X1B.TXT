20 JUN 1999

No changes, but the design is now partitioned into four sections:
  CPU/DECODING  (sheet 1)
  POWER/RESET   (sheet 2)
  I/O FUNCTIONS (sheet 3)
  and MEMORY    (sheet 4)

To view or edit a different sheet, use the EAGLE command

        EDIT .S2

(for example, to edit sheet 2)

The CPU component has been replaced by a "pod." The CPU will
be soldered onto a satellite board, which will plug into the pod.
I'll post the EAGLE library for the pod footprint some time soon.

Shortly, I will make some of the small satellite boards available, with
the Z380 mounted, and wire-wrapping posts for each pin.  Ultimately,
these same boards will plug into header plugs on the main PCB, or can
be soldered into the thru-holes with wire-wrap pins on the main PCB.
